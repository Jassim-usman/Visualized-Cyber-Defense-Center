This Projects serves below usecases:
 - **Centralized Data Collection** Aggregate logs from various sources into a single system.
 - **Data Normalization & Parsing** Structure data for consistency and ease of analysis.
 - **Visualize Data** Use Kibana to generate insights into security threats.
 - **Security Analytics & Visualization** Use Kibana to generate insights into security threats.
 - **Incident & Case Management** Automate case creation from security alerts.
 - **Threat Hunting & Automation** Threat Hunting & Automation
 - **Scalable Observable Analysis**Automate analysis of observables at scale by querying a single tool instead of multiple systems.
 - **Active Threat Response & Collaboration** Enable real-time interaction between security teams and stakeholders.
 - **Threat Intelligence Integration** Enrich data feeds with Open Source Threat Intelligence platforms to enhance detection and response capabilities.

# ‚ò∏Components(First Phase of Implementation):
All of the components used in this projects are Open Source.
 - **TheHive**: TheHive is a scalable 3-in-1 open source Security Incident Response Platform designed to support SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs, and security teams in investigating and responding to incidents.
    - Official GitRepo **[HERE](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive)**
 - **Cortex**: An open-source tool by TheHive Project for analyzing observables such as IP addresses, domain names, and hashes at scale via a Web interface or REST API.
    - Official GitRepo of Cortex is **[HERE](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex)**
 - **MISP**: A threat intelligence platform for sharing, storing, and analyzing security incidents and malware indicators.
   - Official GitRepo of MISP is **[HERE](https://github.com/MISP/MISP)**
- **Wazuh**: Wazuh is an open-source security monitoring solution for host-based intrusion detection, log analysis, and threat intelligence.
   - Official GitRepo of Wazuh is **[HERE](https://wazuh.com/)**


# ‚ò∏Additional Components(Second Phase of Implementation):
 - **Filebeat**:Filebeat is a lightweight shipper for forwarding and centralizing log data.
 - **Company Ticketing System**: An integrated system for tracking and managing security incidents efficiently.
 

# üîΩInstallation-Requirements: 
We have deployed this project in a VM-based environment. You can follow the same setup or choose an alternative platform based on your infrastructure requirements.
## ‚òÅVVirtual Machine (VM) Specifications:
Below are the recommended VM configurations for each component:
- MISP - Ubuntu 20 - t3.micro (Lightweight instance for threat intelligence sharing)
- Cortex - Ubuntu 20 - t3a.medium (Can also run on t2.medium)
- TheHive - Ubuntu 20 - t2.medium (Optimized for incident response and case management)
- Wazuh - Ubuntu 20 - t2.medium (Security monitoring and log analysis)
- Filebeat - Ubuntu 20 - t2.micro (Log shipper for data collection)
- Company Ticketing System - Ubuntu 20 - t2.micro (For tracking and managing security incidents)
