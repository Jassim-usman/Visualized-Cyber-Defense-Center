# 🛡️ Visualized Cyber Defense Center

**Building a robust SOC is crucial.** This project empowers you to explore and implement a modern SOC architecture using open-source tools. Dive into threat detection, analysis, and response!

## 👑 Project Overview

This project provides hands-on experience with a comprehensive SOC setup. We leverage powerful open-source components to create a solid foundation for security analysis and operations.

## 🎯 Goals and Benefits

Our mission is to:

*   ✅ **Centralize Security Monitoring:** Establish a unified platform using open-source technologies.
*   ✅ **Enhance Incident Response:** Improve detection and response through threat intelligence and automation.
*   ✅ **Streamline Threat Analysis:** Automate analysis to boost SOC efficiency.
*   ✅ **Visualize Security Data:** Provide insightful security analytics and visualizations for informed decision-making.
*   ✅ **Enable Real-Time Threat Hunting:** Facilitate proactive threat hunting with behavioral and signature-based detection.
*   ✅ **Standardize Incident Handling:** Implement structured incident handling with case management and response workflows.

## 🚀 Use Cases

This project addresses key security use cases:

*   **Centralized Data Collection:** Aggregate logs from diverse sources.
*   **Data Normalization & Parsing:** Structure data for consistent analysis.
*   **Security Analytics & Visualization:** Gain insights with Kibana (or similar).
*   **Incident & Case Management:** Automate case creation from alerts.
*   **Threat Hunting & Automation:** Proactively hunt and automate responses.
*   **Scalable Observable Analysis:** Analyze observables at scale.
*   **Active Threat Response & Collaboration:** Enable real-time team interaction.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Enrich data with open-source threat intelligence.

## 🧩 Components
