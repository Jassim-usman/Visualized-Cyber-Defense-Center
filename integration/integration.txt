                                     Tools Integration 
                                     Wazuh and TheHive
Prepare TheHive:
1.Create a new organization on TheHive web interface and with an administrator account.
2.In Test Organization, we create a new user with organization administrator privileges.
3.This user has permissions to manage the organization, including creating new users, managing cases, and alerts, amongst others. 
4.We also create a password for this user so that we can log in to view the dashboard and manage cases. 
5.This is done by clicking on “New password” beside the user account and entering the desired password.
6.The integration with Wazuh is possible with the aid of TheHive REST API. 
7.Therefore, we need a user on TheHive that can create alerts via the API. 
8.We create an account with an “analyst” privilege for this purpose.
9.we generate the API key for the user:
10.In order to extract the API key, we reveal the key to view and copy it out for future use:

Configure Wazuh manager:

1.Install TheHive Python module:
sudo /var/ossec/framework/python/bin/pip3 install thehive4py==1.8.1
2.Create the custom integration script by pasting the following python code in /var/ossec/integrations/custom-w2thive.py. 
3.The lvl_threshold variable in the script indicates the minimum alert level that will be forwarded to TheHive. 
4.The variable can be customized so that only relevant alerts are forwarded to TheHive:
5.Custom-w2thive.py:

Create a bash script as /var/ossec/integrations/custom-w2thive. This will properly execute the .py script created in the previous step:
#!/bin/sh
# Copyright (C) 2015-2020, Wazuh Inc.
# Created by Wazuh, Inc. <info@wazuh.com>.
# This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of GP>
WPYTHON_BIN="framework/python/bin/python3"
SCRIPT_PATH_NAME="$0"
DIR_NAME="$(cd $(dirname ${SCRIPT_PATH_NAME}); pwd -P)"
SCRIPT_NAME="$(basename ${SCRIPT_PATH_NAME})"
case ${DIR_NAME} in
    */active-response/bin | */wodles*)
        if [ -z "${WAZUH_PATH}" ]; then
            WAZUH_PATH="$(cd ${DIR_NAME}/../..; pwd)"
        fi
    PYTHON_SCRIPT="${DIR_NAME}/${SCRIPT_NAME}.py"
    ;;
    */bin)
    if [ -z "${WAZUH_PATH}" ]; then
        WAZUH_PATH="$(cd ${DIR_NAME}/..; pwd)"
    fi
    PYTHON_SCRIPT="${WAZUH_PATH}/framework/scripts/${SCRIPT_NAME}.py"
    ;;
     */integrations)
        if [ -z "${WAZUH_PATH}" ]; then
            WAZUH_PATH="$(cd ${DIR_NAME}/..; pwd)"
        fi
    PYTHON_SCRIPT="${DIR_NAME}/${SCRIPT_NAME}.py"
    ;;
esac
${WAZUH_PATH}/${WPYTHON_BIN} ${PYTHON_SCRIPT} $@
6.Change the files’ permission and the ownership to ensure that Wazuh has adequate permissions to access and run them:
sudo chmod 755 /var/ossec/integrations/custom-w2thive.py
sudo chmod 755 /var/ossec/integrations/custom-w2thive
sudo chown root:ossec /var/ossec/integrations/custom-w2thive.py
sudo chown root:ossec /var/ossec/integrations/custom-w2thive
NOTE:

The correct ownership for Wazuh 4.3.0 is root:wazuh.
7.Allow Wazuh to run the integration script, Add the following lines to the manager configuration file located at /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf. 
8.Insert the IP address for TheHive server along with the API key that was generated earlier:
<ossec_config>
…
  <integration>
    <name>custom-w2thive</name>
    <hook_url>http://TheHive_Server_IP:9000</hook_url>
    <api_key>RWw/Ii0yE6l+Nnd3nv3o3Uz+5UuHQYTM</api_key>
    <alert_format>json</alert_format>
  </integration>
…
</ossec_config>
9.Restart the manager to apply the changes:
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
10.Log into TheHive with our test user account, and we can see Wazuh generated alerts under the “Alerts” tab:
11.At this point, we can proceed to perform other standard TheHive actions on the alerts, such as creating cases on them or adding them to other existing cases.

Conclusion:
Wazuh is a flexible security solution that integrates well with other solutions. It is open source and gives users the freedom to create and use custom integration scripts. This blog post shows that Wazuh integrates well with TheHive with the aid of custom scripts.

                                                      TheHive and Cortex
Prerequisites:

1.TheHive: Installed and running (v4 or later recommended).
2.Cortex: Installed and running.
3.Connectivity: Ensure TheHive can connect to Cortex (same network or proper firewall rules in place).

Configure Analyzers in Cortex:

1.Ensure Cortex is accessible from TheHive.
2.Configure Analyzers in Cortex:
          Go to Cortex’s web UI and enable the analyzers you need.
          Configure the required settings for each analyzer, such as API keys for third-party services (e.g., VirusTotal, Shodan).
3.Test Analyzers:
          Test each enabled analyzer in Cortex to confirm it works correctly.

Configure Cortex in TheHive:

1.Generate API Key in Cortex:
          Go to Cortex’s web UI → API Keys → Generate a new API key.
          Copy the API key.
2.Add Cortex to TheHive:
          Log in to TheHive as an admin.
          Navigate to Administration → Connectors → Cortex.
          Add a new Cortex instance:
                 Name: Provide a name for the Cortex instance.
                 URL: Enter the Cortex server URL (e.g., http://<cortex-ip>:<port>).
                 API Key: Paste the API key generated earlier.
                 Active: Enable the Cortex connector.
3.Test the connection.

Link Analyzers to TheHive:

1.Map Cortex Analyzers in TheHive:
          Go to Administration → Connectors → Cortex.
          For each enabled analyzer in Cortex, set permissions and link them to TheHive.
2,Set Default Analyzers (Optional):
          Define default analyzers for specific types of observables (e.g., URLs, IPs, hashes).

Test the Integration:

1.Create a case or alert in TheHive.
2.Add observables (e.g., file hash, URL, IP address).
3.Use the Cortex analyzer by:
          Clicking Analyze for an observable.
          Selecting one or more analyzers to run.
4.Verify that the results from Cortex analyzers appear in TheHive.

Automate with Responders (Optional):

1.Cortex responders can automate actions like blocking an IP, isolating a machine, or notifying teams.
2.Configure responders in Cortex, then link and trigger them from TheHive.

Troubleshooting:

1.Check logs for errors:
         TheHive: /var/log/thehive/application.log
         Cortex: /var/log/cortex/application.log
2.Verify network connectivity and API key validity.
